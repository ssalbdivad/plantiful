These delicious scones make a wonderful breakfast or slightly sweet afternoon treat. They’re best served, in my opinion, warm out of the oven, but can be cooled and stored in an airtight container for 1-2 days. I like to make a batch and freeze them so I can pop as many as I want in the oven for breakfast or as a quick treat when we have guests. They are versatile, and though I often make a sweet version with fruits, can be made savory with additions of garlic, seeds, and/or nutritional yeast instead to pair with dinner.

### Ingredients:

1 cup white flour

1 cup whole wheat flour

¼ cup pea protein

¼ cup organic granulated sugar

1 tbsp flaxseed meal

1tbsp baking powder

½ tsp salt

8 tbsp coconut oil or vegan butter, solid

¾ - 1 cup unsweetened almond milk, or vegan milk of choice

1 tsp vanilla

1 cup craisins, or fruit of choice

### Directions

1. Blend all dry ingredients together in a bowl. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
2. Add coconut oil to dry ingredients and use your hands to work until most big pieces are broken down. If you want to make sure you got most of them, shake the bowl a little from side to side and large pieces will move to the surface. It will resemble wet sand.
3. Add craisins, or other fruit of choice. Craisins and other dried fruit tends to stick together. I like adding them in at this stage because it can be easier to break them apart a bit and avoid overmixing or crushing delicate fruits (like blueberries) if folding in later.
4. Mix the vanilla extract in with ¾ cup of the vegan milk of choice and add to bowl. Mix ingredients until everything is just combined, adding additional milk slowly as needed.
5. Sprinkle a little white flour on the counter and roll out the dough into a square. It should be about 9 to 10 inches long and have a height of ½ to ¾ inches.
6. Use a pizza cutter or knife to cut 32 triangles out of the dough
7. Place onto silicone mat on top of a baking sheet.
8. Bake for 16-18 minutes.

### Tips:

When the house is really hot my coconut oil needs to be refrigerated for 15-20 minutes before use. If your oil is melty you won’t get any lamination in your dough. Feel free to refrigerate your dough for 10 minutes before rolling out, or popping the scones in the freezer for a few minutes before cooking if you’re worried they’re getting too warm.

This recipe can easily be frozen before cooking- Just place them out on a silicone mat and put in the freezer for 30 minutes, until solid. After that, they can be moved to a ziploc bag or tupperware container without sticking together, and taken out as needed. Just bake an additional 1-2 minutes.

This recipe calls for ¼ cup of pea protein powder, which can easily be substituted back for regular flour. I use it to bump up the protein content (¼ c has 21 grams of protein), and the best part is you can’t taste a difference. When I make them for my husband and myself, I use ⅓ cup instead, and still can’t taste a difference, but if you’re worried about it changing the flavor at all I’d start with just ¼.

Trying to cut out the calories? I’ve done this recipe with as little as 6 tbsp coconut oil to some success, though it is better with the full 8. And remember, vegan butter has about 20-30 calories less per tablespoon!
