### Ingredients:

whole wheat bread, or bread of choice

1 c. oat milk, or milk of choice

4 tbsp flax meal

3 tbsp white sugar

½ tsp vanilla extract

½ tsp butter flavoring

small amount of vegan butter

### Directions:

1. Whisk together milk, flax meal, sugar, vanilla, and butter flavoring. Wait 5-10 minutes for mixture to thicken.
2. Heat your stovetop pan to medium heat, or electric griddle to 350 degrees. Brush the pan with a little bit of vegan butter.
3. Dip both sides of a slice of bread into the mixture and add to heated skillet.
4. Cook on one side for 4-5 minutes, until golden brown. Flip and cook an additional 4 minutes.

#### Why flax?

Traditional french toast uses egg and milk. Since the eggs are used to bind the liquid to the bread, flax is a wonderful alternative! When its left in liquid, it thickens up (sometimes called a "flax egg") and essentially binds the liquid together. In addition, flax adds a little bit of nutritional benefits, such as Omega-3's that alternative binders like cornstarch don't have.

#### Butter flavoring?

This recipe calls for butter flavoring, which is just a way to add a little richness to the recipe. Feel free to substitute this with additional vanilla extract instead. Remember, this is NOT a butter extract, which would not be vegan. I get mine from [The Spice House](https://www.thespicehouse.com/products/natural-butter-flavor), but there are plenty of places to get it- just make sure to check the ingredients!

#### Tips:

Feel free to make the batter ahead of time and store in the fridge!
