# We're plantiful...

Welcome to Plantiful Cooking, a blog that will hopefully help you realize how easy it is to create healthy and satisfying plant-based meals. Whether you eat plant-based for ethical reasons, health reasons, or are just trying something new, there will be recipes here you can enjoy! Though I do love getting a bit crazy with my ingredients at times to make some really unique dishes, I appreciate that quick and easy meals make a lot of sense for everyday life too. Donâ€™t worry, the blog will have a plantiful, er, I mean _plentiful_, supply of both.
