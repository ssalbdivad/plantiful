Welcome to Plantiful Cooking! I hope this blog will hopefully help you realize how easy it is to create healthy and satisfying plant-based meals.
Whether you eat plant-based for ethical reasons, health reasons, or are just
trying something new, there will be recipes here you can enjoy!

Though I do love getting a bit crazy with my ingredients at times to
make some really unique dishes, I appreciate that quick and easy meals make a
lot of sense for everyday life too. Don't worry, the blog will have a plantiful,
er, I mean _plentiful_, supply of both.

My name is Savannah, and in case you haven't already guessed, I'm very passionate about making delicious plant-based food! I love to create my own recipes, experiment with new flavors and test out new products (especially cheeses!) whenever I get the chance. Eating a vegan diet does not, and should not, mean sacrificing taste. The more people that realize that, the better off the planet will be!

I currently reside near Boston with my husband and six pets. I like yoga, indoor bouldering and temperatures above 75 degrees.
